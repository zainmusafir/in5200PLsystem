To perform Questa compilation:

1. The command "./comp_all.tcl -help" returns the usage with options.

2. To compile the complete design with testbench and test cases run the command "./comp_all.tcl ZEDBOARD SETUP_KBAXI4LITE"

3. To only compile the testbench and test cases run the command "./comp_all_tb.tcl ZEDBOARD SETUP_KBAXI4LITE"


To perform Questa simulation:

5. User must select target equal ZEDBOARD (i.e. currently ZEDBOARD only available) and a test case with sequence.
   Usage: ./simulate.tcl <target> <test case> <sequence> [-gui] [-help]

6. Example: "$MLA_DESIGN/scripts/questa/simulate.tcl  ZEDBOARD  case_psif_reg  psif_reg_test  -gui"

7. Simulation results including coverage data is written to the selected test case simulation directory:
   $MLA_DESIGN/top/svsim/case_<test>/<test>.sim.

8. Example: See the log file "top/svsim/case_psif_reg/psif_reg_test.sim/psif_reg_test.log" after running the simulation above.
   Errors are written to the file "top/svsim/case_psif_reg/psif_reg_test.sim/psif_reg_test_error.log", and is empty when no errors have
   been found in the simulation.

9. Perform all simulations in batch mode with ./simulate_all.tcl <target> [-help]

10. Example "$MLA_DESIGN/scripts/questa/simulate_all.tcl  ZEDBOARD"
